# Contao Bridge Plugin
This plugin is required in order for the Contao Forum Bridge bundle to connect to phpBB.

# Install
1. Install the extension files into `ext/doublespark/contaobridge`.
2. Login to the phpBB ACP as an admin.
3. Enable the extension under the "Customise" tab.
4. Once enabled, go to the "Extensions" tab and set the Contao site URL and secret key.

# Extra
Once setup, Contao will handle all account functions such as login and logout. Any visible
log in forms in phpBB should be disabled, for example the "Quick login" form on the home page
of the prosilver theme.
